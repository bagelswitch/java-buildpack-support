# Java Buildpack Support

A collection of JARs in support of the Java Buildpack.

## Building

This project is built with Gradle. To build the JARs:

	./gradlew
	
To publish the JARs to Amazon S3, use the `publish` target:

	./gradlew publish

## Tomcat Buildpack Support

This is a JAR which the Java buildpack places in Tomcat's `lib` directory. It contains a listener which,
when configured in Tomcat, ensures that Tomcat shuts down if an application fails to start.
